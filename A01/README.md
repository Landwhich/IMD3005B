## Questions for the Assignment

### *Disclaimer!* 
The assets (models, textures, images, fonts) and (Blue / Pink geometric shader are not mine and have been used in junction with my own work to amplify it)

### 1. Controls and Design
    I created a horrifically innacurate planet orbit simulator in 3D with lighting and controls. I have a rocket ship following the mouse, which will spew smoke on mouse press. There are four planets orbitting the sun with two of them having a moon satellite.
### 2. The most Challenging Part
    The most Challenging aspect of this assignment was getting up to speed with the tools required to create and work on my project. I have since become quite familiar with them thanks to this bootcamp assignment.
### 3. What Went well 
    I really like how easy it was to create a 3D scene and light it. Textures especially came easy after a bit of tinkering and I think there a lot of nice QoL features in this library. While only experimenting a little on this assignment, playing around with the smoke on the rocket and using classes in junction with the built methods was quite cool. excited for the next projects.
